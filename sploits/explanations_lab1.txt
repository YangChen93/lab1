Target1:
  The foo does not check if the input arg is smaller than 96bytes, so that we can overflow the buffer to overwrite the return address via strcpy().

Target2:
  The target checked the length but we can still touch the "len" and "i" within that length, so we overwrite the len to 283 that we can overwrite return address
  
Target3:
  Target3 is similar to Target1, we can overwrite the return address easily. But we need to take care of the additional "AAAA" in the buffer.
  
Target4:
  Target4 is similar to Target2, we can overwrite the length that the target used to check the input. Then we use the env() to contain the i and return address.
